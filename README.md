# Online-Garage-
We created project using 
   Java servlets
   JSP pages
   JSTL
   Bootstrap
   Mysql 


We made a Garage Management System with Admin and Customer panels
Admin can manage the services by
  -Inserting new services
  -Editing existing services
  -Removing Services
  and View them

Customer can make Appointments for their vehicle 
The Appointment once made will be Displayed in the invoice section
Invoice section is what we call a Job card which lists all the services you chose along with the Estimated amount and Time required for the Service

Hope it helps Thankyou
